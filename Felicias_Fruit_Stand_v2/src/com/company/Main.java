//      Felicia's fruit stand has upgraded. She now serves fruits and meat now.


//        Objects
//        1. Create a Product class this should contain data that any item she sells will have
//        2. Create a Fruit class that inherits from the Product class that contain fruit specific data.
//        3. Create a Meat class that inherits from the product class that contains Meat specific data.
//        Be creative with your classes.
//
//
//        Code
//        1. In the main class create a Product list
//        2. add to the list three different Meats and 3 different Fruits.
//        3. in the main class create a method called displayProducts it should accept a Product list and display all the items in the list.
//        4. Create a second displayProducts class that accepts a Product list AND a string 'type' if the type is meat only print the
//          meat products and if fruit only display the fruit products
//        a. extra challenge try using a switch statement for this instead of ifelse
//        5. create a displayProduct method that accepts a product list and an int i. print out the product at index i.
//
//
//        be aware that except for the switch statement you should have all the code you need in Thursday's walkthrough.
//        You'll need to adjust some items and use them in different ways to fit this exercise however there are new new concepts in this challenge.
//        Try this by yourself first and see how far you get, You may work with a classmate starting on Tuesday.
//        Of course if you get completely stuck you can ask for help in slack.
